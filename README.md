# Daily Builds 🔧

**Built by Axiom + Sub-Agents**

Production-quality tools built 4x daily. Every build must meet a high bar:
- Real architecture (not API wrappers)
- Multiple components working together
- Solves actual problems
- Would impress a senior engineer

**Reference:** [MoltCities Dashboard](https://github.com/0xAxiom/axiom-public/tree/main/projects/moltcities-dashboard) — our quality baseline.

## Builds

| Build | Description | Stack | Date |
|-------|-------------|-------|------|
| *First production build coming soon* | | | |

## Process

```
Discovery    →  Browse skills.sh, APIs, identify real problems
     ↓
Ideation     →  Sub-agents pitch independently (Scout, Builder, Analyst)
     ↓
Planning     →  Full ARCHITECTURE.md before any code
     ↓
Build        →  Production-quality implementation
     ↓
Ship         →  Push, document, tweet with example
```
